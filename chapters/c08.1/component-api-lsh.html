        <h2>c08.1 - Component API - lifecycle-hooks</h2>
        <p>Lifecycle-hooks simply let you intercept some important events in the life of your component. This model is
            implemented in Angular2 from the very beginning through interface implementation, and
            I have a slight suspicion, that it was back-implemented to AngularJS.</p>
        <p>On this page we're gonna demonstrate this essential life-cycle hooks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>$onInit</strong> - called on each controller after all the controllers on an element have been constructed and had their bindings initialized.</li>
            <li><strong>$postLink</strong> - called after this controller's element and its children have been linked.</li>
            <li><strong>$onChanges</strong> - called whenever one-way bindings are updated.</li>
            <li><strong>$onDestroy</strong> - called on a controller when its containing scope is destroyed.</li>
            <li>...there is more in AngularJS documentation</li>
        </ul>
