<h2>c01 - Survival guide</h2>
<ul class="survival">
    <li>Break your up to building blocks - e.g. separate directives, controllers, use module dependencies.
    </li>
    <li>Organize your up by features, not by file types.</li>
    <li>Use file naming conventions and stick with them - do not let others invent their own, if they work with the same
        code
    </li>
    <li>Prefix your own directives, make a system in it</li>
    <li>Do not experiment with low-level or Angular-private APIs - doesn't pay off</li>
    <li>Thing before you integrate 3rd party component - sometimes it is much better to write your own, simpler
        version
    </li>
    <li>Be minimalistic - example: why to integrate bower + npm, when npm is much bigger and you can find everything
        what's on bower on npm as well.
    </li>
    <li>Do not stash things for "later use", if you don't use them now, get rid of them!</li>
    <li>Do not try to be wiser then Angular documentation and do not re-invent the wheel</li>
    <li>Profile performance from the very beginning and continuously</li>
    <li>Keep the browser's console clean - no red error messages, no debug messages should be delivered to production
    </li>
    <li>Refactor on the fly, continuously. There is a way how to do it in non-violent way.</li>
    <li>If you wanna be an Angular devel - try to keep the tempo of Angular framework development - see point above.
    </li>
    <li>Do not let users sniff your code - bundle, minimize, obfuscate. The code is not their business.</li>
    <li>Keep your code nice - well formatted, it improves readability (Ctrl + Alt + L in WebStorm, Ctrl + E,D in Visual
        Studio)
    </li>
    <li>Listen to WebStorm JS or TS lint - it is not right every time, but in 99 % of cases it is.</li>
</ul>
