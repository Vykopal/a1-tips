<h1>Component directives - example for A1 < 1.5</h1>
Note:
This is fully functional and recommended way to write components for A1, which can be easily migrated to A2 components. <br>
This version works for AngularJS version < 1.5, AngularJS 1.5 introduces "component API", which is even more convenient for
many reasons, and also for later upgrade to A2 components.
