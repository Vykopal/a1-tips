<h2>Component API</h2>

<p>The basic difference when declaring component is, that unlike directive it doesn't tak a factory function, but just
the component definition object.</p>

<p>The bindings are somehow distinguished between inputs (&lt;, @) and outputs (&)</p>

<p>They're designed to use controllerAs pattern, not operate with $scope object</p>
